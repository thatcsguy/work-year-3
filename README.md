# Anniversary Game - Distance Challenge Visualization

A beautiful web-based visualization for your anniversary game where players try to position themselves as far as possible from all other players on a 50x50 coordinate grid.

## üéØ How the Game Works

1. Players fill out a Google Form with X and Y coordinates (0-50)
2. The goal is to be the player farthest from all other players
3. Distance is calculated using the standard Euclidean distance formula
4. The visualization shows all players and highlights the top 3 winners

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Option 1: Open Directly in Browser
1. Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. No server setup required!

### Option 2: Local Server (Recommended for CSV uploads)
If you encounter issues with CSV file uploads due to browser security restrictions:

```bash
# Using Python (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP (if installed)
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## üèÜ Scoring System

The game uses the **nearest neighbor distance** scoring method:

1. For each player, find the distance to their closest neighbor
2. The player with the greatest distance to their nearest neighbor wins!
3. This rewards the most isolated players - those who positioned themselves farthest from everyone else

This method identifies true isolation rather than just average positioning, making for more strategic gameplay.

- **Libraries Used**:
  - Chart.js for the scatter plot visualization

The visualization is easy to customize:

- **Colors**: Edit the CSS color schemes in `styles.css`
